## Research Questions
1. **Conversation Length Prediction**  
   How accurately can the length of a conversation with ChatGPT be predicted based on the initial prompt and context?  

2. **Programming Language Accuracy**  
   How satisfactory are ChatGPT's responses to various programming languages based on developers' prompts?  

3. **Performance Deterioration Points**  
   At what stage of the conversation on average does ChatGPT fail in a particular coding language?

## Methodology
- **Data Cleansing**: The dataset, originally 200MB, was reduced to 40MB using PowerShell, and further segmented for easier processing.  
- **Data Integration**: Conversations were transformed into JSON format for structured analysis.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The last 10% of conversations was analyzed for sentiment scoring (-1 to +1) to gauge user satisfaction.  
- **Advanced Modeling**: Neural networks, regression models, and NLP techniques were used for prediction and analysis.

---

## Key Findings
- Python emerged as the most frequently used programming language, with high user satisfaction levels.
- Sentiment analysis provided valuable insights into user satisfaction across different programming languages.
- Future work focuses on deeper analysis of failure points and enhancing ChatGPT‚Äôs performance in technical interactions.
